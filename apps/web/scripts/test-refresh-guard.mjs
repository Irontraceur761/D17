/**
 * Regression check for the launch-refresh generation guard.
 *
 * Scenario: a slow activity refresh for launch A is still in flight when the
 * user selects launch B. When A's reads finally resolve, none of A's results
 * — pool address, pool composition, activity, caches, or status — may be
 * committed, and A must not clear the loading flags or surface errors that
 * belong to B's in-flight request. Deterministic: promise resolution order
 * is fully controlled, no network, no timers.
