 * Generation guard for launch-scoped refreshes.

 * loading-flag clears belonging to a stale generation must never be
 * committed — otherwise a slow refresh for launch A can write A's data onto
 * launch B.
 *
 * All launch-scoped commits go through commitIfCurrentGeneration so the
 * gating behavior is testable in isolation.
